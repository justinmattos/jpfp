        This app was built by Justin Mattos for their Junior Phase Final Project
        at Fullstack Academy. You can view a list of campuses and students with
        either of the two option in the main navigation, as well as interact
        with these databases by adding, editing and deleting entries. Pagination
        and sorting make these lists more manageable to read.
